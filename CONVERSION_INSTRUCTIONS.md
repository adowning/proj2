Convert the PHP class in BaseSlotSettings.php to TypeScript, preserving its exact original structure, functionality, logic, calculations, and all code elements (including any seemingly unnecessary or legacy parts) without any modifications beyond language conversion—alterations to any formula, value, or algorithmic behavior could cause crashes in communicating legacy clients. Output a standalone, complete, runnable TypeScript file (.ts extension) using modern TypeScript syntax (e.g., strict mode, ES6+ features like arrow functions or async/await where naturally applicable), while enforcing type safety through interfaces, types, generics, and annotations where beneficial (without changing runtime behavior). Include proper imports for any assumed standard libraries (e.g., Node.js or browser equivalents) and exports for the class. For PHP-specific constructs not directly mappable to TypeScript (e.g., traits, magic methods like __get or __set, or global variables), provide direct functional equivalents with inline comments explaining the translation and any necessary assumptions or polyfills; avoid third-party libraries unless essential for equivalency. Ensure the code compiles without errors in a standard TypeScript environment and maintains the public API exactly as in the original PHP for compatibility. If the PHP code contains embedded strings or data that imply external dependencies, replicate them faithfully in TypeScript. Do not omit, refactor, optimize, or modernize any part of the code—preserve whitespace, comments, and line structures where possible for easy mapping back to the original. Handle type assertions/conversion for PHP's loose typing by using appropriate TypeScript unions or any types with comments indicating potential runtime casting, ensuring no behavioral changes. Output only the TypeScript file content, starting from the first line of code, with no leading explanations, file headers, or additional metadata.
